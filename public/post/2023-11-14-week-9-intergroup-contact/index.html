		<h1 class="post-title">Week 9: Intergroup Contact</h1>
<div class="post-line"></div>

		

		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction:</h2>
<p>In this week&rsquo;s blog post, I am examining the idea of intergroup contact within a society. This includes situations like public transportation, sports, and neighborhoods. With all societies becoming significantly more diverse, understanding the outcomes of this on individuals is imperative. Will intergroup contact create <em>conflict</em> or <em>contact?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Conflict: sharing space causes negative attitudes and behaviors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contact: sharing space causes positive attitudes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This blog seeks to answer the question of whether contact with a member of an outgroup can change people&rsquo;s perception of that group? The study and methods in this blog is a recreation of the study conducted by Dong Wang, Iain Johnstonand Baoyu Wang. Wang et al. (2021). They conducted an experiment on a group of Chinese students to determine if imagined social contact could reduce antipathy toward Japanese people. I also use class-wide data that resembles the Wang et a. (2021) study, in which students students imagined social contact with a member of the opposite political party.</p>
<h2 id="data">Data</h2>
<p>In both studies, Wang et al. (2021) and the class survey, subjects were asked to imagine a bus ride, either one in which they talked to a Japanese (other political party) person (treatment) or just enjoyed the scenery (control). They were then asked a series of questions to assess their affective feelings toward the out-group and toward their own group.</p>
<p><strong>Wang et al. (2021):</strong></p>
<p>The data from the Wang et al.(2021) study includes 120 responses with 24 variables.</p>
<p>A list of the important variables to this blog are shown below:</p>

<h2 id="part-1-wang-et-al-2021">Part 1: Wang et al. (2021):</h2>
<p>In the first section of the blog, I analyze the data presented by Want et al. (2021). I first consider average affect scores for Chinese versus Japanese people and compare these for the control and treatment groups. I then consider the difference in averages to identify statistical significance of the treatment. Finally, I model affect scores based on chosen control variables.</p>
<h3 id="distribution-of-affect-scores">Distribution of Affect Scores</h3>
<p>The histograms below show the distribution of average affect scores for Chinese and Japanese for the control and treatment groups. The dotted line shows the median for each of these groups. For both the control and treatment groups, there is a significant difference between Chinese and Japanese ratings. Both groups have higher ratings for Chinese people.</p>
<img src="http://example.org/post/2023-11-14-week-9-intergroup-contact/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="1440" />
<h3 id="positivity-score-averages">Positivity Score Averages</h3>
<p>In this section I selected one of the affect measures, positivity and conducted a t-test for Japanese and Chinese ratings for the treatment and control. I then conducted a t-test for average ratings between the treatment and control.</p>
<h4 id="chinese">Chinese</h4>
<p><img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202023-11-14%20at%209.55.10%20PM.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The t-test shows that the mean rating for Chinese among the treated is lower than that of the control. However, these results are statistically insignificant.</p>
<h4 id="japanese">Japanese</h4>
<p><img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202023-11-14%20at%209.45.53%20PM.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The t-test shows that the mean rating for Japanese among the treated is higher than that of the control. Further, these results are statistically significant, demonstrating the treatment was effective in improving the positivity rating of Japanese people among Chinese students in this study.</p>
<h4 id="average-affection-difference-comparison">Average Affection Difference Comparison</h4>
<p><img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202023-11-14%20at%208.49.42%20PM.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This t-test considers the difference in average affect scores between Chinese and Japanese people for the treatment and control grups. The output is the mean difference between ratings. A lower value demonstrates there is less animosity toward Japanese people. The results are statistically significant and show that the treated had a smaller difference than the control, indicating the treatment was effective.</p>
<h2 id="modeling-affect">Modeling Affect:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dependent Variable : <code>AffectDiff_avg</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Control Variables: <strong><code>jpfriend</code></strong> and <code>age</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Null) Hypothesis 1a: There will no be difference between those with a Japanese friend and those without&rsquo;s ratings of Chinese versus Japanese people after receiving the treatment about imagining positive contact with a Japanese person.</p>
<ul>
<li>If we find that there is a statistically significant difference between these groups, we would reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the effect of the treatment on having a Japanese friend or not.</li>
<li>I would expect those with Japanese friends to be less critical toward Japanese people in general. This could be due to heuristic thinking, in which people substitute the question of their opinion toward Japanese people with their opinion toward their Japanese friend.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Null) Hypothesis 2a: There will be no difference in ratings between older versus younger people</p>
<ul>
<li>If we find that there is a statistically significant difference between older and younger respondents,we would reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the effect of the treatment on those of different ages.</li>
<li>In this age demographic, I would expect older people to be less critical because they have spent more time away from home, where traditional beliefs, such as cemented symbolic attitudes like disapproval toward Japanese people, would likely exist.</li>

</code></pre><h4 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Treatment]{.underline}: The coefficient value for treatment demonstrates that when subjects receive the subject, the difference between ratings for Chinese and Japanese people decrease by 0.647, when holding age and whether the person has a Japanese friend constant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[(Null) Hypothesis 1a:]{.underline} There is no statistically significant difference between ratings for those with and without a Japanese friends due to the treatment. Therefore, <strong>we fail to reject the null hypothesis</strong> that there is no difference between people with and without a Japanese friend&rsquo;s ratings of Chinese versus Japanese people after receiving the treatment about imagining positive contact with a Japanese person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[(Null) Hypothesis 1a:]{.underline} There is no statistically significant difference between ratings for older and youger respondents due to the treatment. Therefore, <strong>we fail to reject the null hypothesis</strong> that there is no difference between younger and older people&rsquo;s ratings of Chinese versus Japanese people after receiving the treatment about imagining positive contact with a Japanese person.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The graph below visualizes these confidence intervals, demonstrating that none of the control variables, only treatment, are statistically significant because zero is included in the confidence interval.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-class-data">Part 2: Class Data</h2>
<p>In this section of the blog, I consider the data from the class survey that replicated the Wang et al. (2021) study. Rather than Chinese versus Japanese, this study considers the opposing political party. The out-party is equivalent to the Japanese in the Wang et al. (2021) study.</p>
<h3 id="distribution-of-affect-scores-1">Distribution of Affect Scores:</h3>
<p>The histograms below show the average affect scores toward the in-party and out-party for the treated and control groups. The red dashed line displays the median. Like the graphs in the previous section, for both the treated and control, there is a large difference in the average affect scores for the in and out groups. For both treatment and control, the in-party receives a higher rating.</p>
<img src="http://example.org/post/2023-11-14-week-9-intergroup-contact/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="1440" />
<h3 id="positivity-score-averages-1">Positivity Score Averages</h3>
<p>After identifying the difference in affect scores, I look to measure this value through t-tests. I selected one of the affect measures, positivity, and then conducted a t-test for average ratings between the treatment and control.</p>
<h4 id="in-group">In Group</h4>
<p><img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202023-11-14%20at%209.33.39%20PM.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The t-test displays the difference between positivity scores for treatment and control for the in-party. The results are statistically insignificant.</p>
<h4 id="out-group">Out Group</h4>
<p><img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202023-11-14%20at%209.33.22%20PM.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The t-test displays the difference between positivity scores for treatment and control for the out-party. The results are statistically insignificant.</p>
<h4 id="average-affection-difference-comparison-1">Average Affection Difference Comparison</h4>
<p><img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202023-11-14%20at%209.33.05%20PM.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The t-test displays the difference between average affect scores between in-party and out-party, from the treatment and control. The results are statistically insignificant.</p>
