## Introduction:

## Data:

The data utilized in this blog is from Reny and Newman (2021). They "exploit" a survey already "in the field", including when the murder of George Floyd occurred. The survey was a weekly survey assessing individuals ideologies and beliefs toward certain topics, including police favorability and one's perception of the level of discrimination in U.S faced by Black Amercians. The data spans 419 days, from July 18th, 2019 to September 9th, 2020. The data includes 377,507 entries.

## Comparison in Averages:

### Police:

The results below show the difference in average favorability toward police before the killing of George Floyd and after. From these results we see there is a significant decline in favorability after the killing. This is due to the small p-value and the confidence interval not including zero, allowing us to reject the null hypothesis that there was no relationship between the murder and change in favorability. Looking directly at the means, the mean of x (before the killing) is smaller than the mean of y (after the killing). Favorability of police is coded on a 1-4 scale in which 1 is very favorable and 4 is very unfavorable. Therefore, a postive difference in \~0.15 means that on average, police favoriability decreased by \~0.15.
