## Class Notes:

-   Sands 2017:

    -   Found that people were less likely to support extra tax on millionaires when exposed to a "poverty-stricken" person

    -   Hypotheses:

        -   just world view -\> construct reasons why it should exist

        -   concern that the tax could one day impact you

    -   unconstrained and unstable nature of police attitudes shows that most attitudes are not coherent, but perhaps just represent fragmentary responses to stimuli.
