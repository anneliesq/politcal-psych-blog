## Introduction:

## Data:

The data utilized in this blog is from Reny and Newman (2021). They "exploit" a survey already "in the field", including when the murder of George Floyd occurred. The survey was a weekly survey assessing individuals ideologies and beliefs toward certain topics, including police favorability and one's perception of the level of discrimination in U.S faced by Black Amercians. The data spans 419 days, from July 18th, 2019 to September 9th, 2020. The data includes 377,507 entries.

A list of key variables utilized in this blog can be found below:

## Comparison in Averages:

### Police:

The results below show the difference in average favorability toward police before the killing of George Floyd and after. From these results we see there is a significant decline in favorability after the killing. This is due to the small p-value and the confidence interval not including zero, allowing us to reject the null hypothesis that there was no relationship between the murder and change in favorability. Looking directly at the means, the mean of x (before the killing) is smaller than the mean of y (after the killing). Favorability of police is coded on a 1-4 scale in which 1 is very favorable and 4 is very unfavorable. Therefore, a postive difference in \~0.15 means that on average, police favoriability decreased by \~0.15.

```{r biases}
load('RN_2001_data.RData')
#Change the object to be the date of the protest spread, remember to put it in quotes if you copy/paste!
day_0 <- unique(protest_df$day[protest_df$day_running == 0])


protest_df_bydate <- protest_df |>
  mutate(before = ifelse(day<as.Date(day_0), 1,0))

```

```{r}
t_test_police <- t.test(x=protest_df_bydate$group_favorability_the_police[protest_df_bydate$before == 1], ## before
       y=protest_df_bydate$group_favorability_the_police[protest_df_bydate$before == 0]) ## after

## after killing, police became less favorable
```

### Perception of Discrimination Faced By Black Americans

Similar to police favorability, we can assess the average perception of discrimination faced by Black Americans. The results show there was a significant increase in perception of discrimination due to the confidence interval not including zero and a small p-value (reject null hypothesis). The means show that, on average, perception of discrimination increased by \~0.14 before and after the killing of George Floyd. This is because discriminatio is coded on a 1-5 scale, in which higher numbers are associated with higher levels of discrimination.

```{r}
t_test_discrimination <- t.test(x=protest_df_bydate$discrimination_blacks[protest_df_bydate$before == 1], ## before
       y=protest_df_bydate$discrimination_blacks[protest_df_bydate$before == 0]) ## after

## average perception of discrimination faced by Black people increased
## t-values are big and p-values are very small, unlikely to happen by chance
```

## Replication of Reny and Newman (2021):

```{r, include = FALSE}
race_df <- protest_df_bydate %>% 
  mutate(race = case_when(hispanic == 0 | race_ethnicity == 1 ~ "Non-Hispanic White",
                          race_ethnicity == 2 ~ "Black",
                          hispanic == 1 ~ "Latino",
                          race_ethnicity >= 4 & race_ethnicity <= 14 ~ "Asian American",
                          race_ethnicity == 15 ~ "Other Race"
                          ),
         day_diff = as.integer(day - day_0))

average_date <- race_df %>% 
  select(day_diff, group_favorability_the_police, discrimination_blacks, before, race) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  group_by(day_diff, before, race) %>% 
  summarize(avg_police = mean(group_favorability_the_police),
            avg_discrimination = mean(discrimination_blacks))

```
