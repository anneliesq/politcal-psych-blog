        <h2 class="catalogue-title">Week 5: The Political Psychology of Trump Indictment</h2>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Introduction: This week&rsquo;s blog post considers the public opinion around the Trump indictments. Former President Trump was charged with 91 crimes, two being federal indictments, one in New York, and one in Georgia. These indictments have significance in two ways: he is the first former President to be charged with state or federal crimes, and these trials will be ongoing during the presidential campaign (Lecture (10/11), slide 5).
In this blog, I consider two behaviors voters can express.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Introduction This week&rsquo;s blog post considers the role of hierarchies and the idea of social dominance theory. Social dominance orientation (SDO) refers to the &ldquo;general support for the domination of certain socially constructed groups over other socially constructed groups, regardless of the manner in which these groups are defined&rdquo; (Sidanious, pg. 61). These groups can greatly vary including different demographic characteristics and belief systems, such as political orientation.
The main question that drives this blog post is to what degree can vote choice be as a function of SDO and other variables of interest?

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Introduction: This week’s blog post considers the role of groups and identities in politics, specifically around party affiliation and the impacts of polarization. The study outlined in the blog serves as a replication of Iyengar, Sood, and Lelkes (2012) study. They seek to find the “proportion upset, displeased, or unhappy, if progeny married someone from another party.” To replicate this study, our class took a survey asking their happiness level (very unhappy to very happy) if their child married a Republican and, similarly, if they married a democrat.

        <h2 class="catalogue-title">Week 2: Natural Selection and the Political Mind</h2>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Introduction In this week’s blog, I look at decision making and the way in which cooperation occurs between two parties. The importance of cooperation can be traced through an evolutionary lens. According to Axelrod, “Many of the benefits sought by living things are disproportionately available to cooperating groups” (pg. 92). Axelrod is asserting that psychological traits favoring cooperation were favored through natural selection, indicating humans today should lean toward cooperation when possible.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Introduction For this week’s post, I am looking at the relationship of perceived candidate competence and electoral success. The subjectivity of measuring competence illustrates how other variables may persist in an individual’s decision making process to ultimately determine competence. This idea can be defined as attribute substitution, in which a difficult question (such as defining competence) is substituted for an easier one. A method of substitution is evaluating a candidate’s competence based on their facial quality.
