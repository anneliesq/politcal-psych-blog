		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction:</h2>
<p>This week&rsquo;s blog evaluates the impact of gender on political outcomes, specifically surrounding conflict and war. Through past weeks, I have introduced the idea of SDO (Social Dominance Theory) and evolutionary principles that carry to today&rsquo;s decisions. These ideas are significant with regard to gender. We see that women are typically more liberal than men (lower SDO scores). Further, due to different reproductive strategies, men have an evolved trait that males power, in this case through political careers, for desirable than compared to women. These discrepancies are evident across political representation: 26 out of197 world leaders are women and only 6% of countries have more than 50% women in their legislative body (partially due to gender quotas).</p>
<p>This blog is driven by Trager and Barnhart (2023)&rsquo;s study. They consider whether gender contributes to a country&rsquo;s likelihood of initiating war with another country. I consider the likelihood of war over since the 1900s, the difference between woman&rsquo;s suffrage and woman&rsquo;s civil liberties as a predictor variable for polity score, and the geographic trends for woman&rsquo;s suffrage.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Why are women typically more liberal than men?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Different reproductive strategies, men have more of a taste of hierarchy, and have an evolved trait that makes men more likely to seek power and political careers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>boys and girls are socialized differently: competitive sports</p>

<li>
<p>systematic differences in political behavior:</p>

<li>
<p>men are far more likely to hold political office than women</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>men are on average more conservative</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>only 26/197 world leaders are women</p>
<ul>
<li>only 6 countries with more than 50% women (but could be due to quotas)</li>

<li>
<p>sexual selection leads to different selected pressures that demonstrates how and why women and men behave differently</p>
<ul>
<li>males have a taste for power</li>

<li>
<p>sources of deferentially socialized political behavior across genders:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Household: parents and siblings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sports: socialization reinforcing biology</p>

<li>
<p>&ldquo;increasing levels of women suffrage = reduction conflict&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="data">Data:</h2>
<p>The data utilized in this blog is country-level data, organized by county and year, from Trager and Barnhart (2023). There are a total of 9,865 entries, across 157 countries and spanning from 1990 to 2007. The primary variables of interest are <code>polity</code>, <code>suffrage</code>, <code>wcivillibs.</code></p>

<h2 id="is-war-common">Is War Common?</h2>
<p>I first consider the aggregated number of wars initiated by each country each year. The histogram below shows the number of country&rsquo;s that initiated a certain number of wars. Each year is evaluated separately, indicating why the y value of count is nearly 8,000 for the 0 bar. It is evident that 0 is the highest frequency and 1 and 2 are the next highest peaks. From this graph, it is apparent that wars are relatively uncommon. However, this graph fails to show the total wars for a given country or the time-based trends that could be occurring.</p>

## When Does War Happen?
The histogram below shows the average number of wars per year. There are obvious spikes around the first and second world wars, significantly with World War II. However, after WW2, there does not appear to be an upward or downward trend, indicating war could be relatively stable and more peaceful. However, this does not consider the increasing number of countries over the years.

## More Countries, More Wars?
The histogram below depicts the number of wars for a given year. There is an obvious upward trend in this count. This could be attributed to numerous factors including more countries and decolonization. Further, there is not an indicator for the intensity of conflict, meaning these results have some ambiguity as World War's are rated at the same degree as a less prominent conflict.
