		<h1 class="post-title">Week 4: Hierarchies</h1>
<div class="post-line"></div>

		

		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This week&rsquo;s blog post considers the role of hierarchies and the idea of social dominance theory. Social dominance orientation (SDO) refers to the &ldquo;general support for the domination of certain socially constructed groups over other socially constructed groups, regardless of the manner in which these groups are defined&rdquo; (Sidanious, pg. 61). These groups can greatly vary including different demographic characteristics and belief systems, such as political orientation.</p>
<p>The main question that drives this blog post is to what degree can vote choice be as a function of SDO and other variables of interest? Essentially, this blog uses vote choice as an outcome variable, and evaluates different models, all including SDO, to most effectively analyze the relationship between outcome and selected predictor variables.</p>
<h2 id="sdo-survey">SDO Survey</h2>
<p>The usage of SDO in this blog is through a 16 question survey. The picture below displays the survey:</p>
<p><img src="qualtrics.png" alt="Survey Results"></p>
<p>In the replicated survey, I displayed the 16 questions in two groups. Originally the first section of the survey was title &ldquo;Dominance Sub-Scale&rdquo; and the second group was titled &ldquo;Anti-Egalitarianism Sub-Scale.&rdquo; However, I removed these labels so that the participant would not be influenced by the topic of the questions. Further, I randomized the order of the questions in each group with questions from the other group. This way the participant would be more likely to think about their response to each question and not aimlessly respond, repeating their answer from before because the question was similar.</p>
<h2 id="data">Data</h2>
<p>The data used in this blog is a condensed version of survey conducted and generated by <a href="%5Bhttps://wthh.dataforprogress.org/get-the-data">Data for Progress</a> in 2018. The data includes 3,144 rows (individuals) and 15 columns. The variables are primarily categorical variables, measuring the individuals&rsquo; position on different questions with political undertones. The data also includes demographic variables such as race, education, sex, and age. The variables used in this blog are included below:</p>

<h2 id="social-dominance-orientation">Social Dominance Orientation</h2>
<p>Before analyzing the effectiveness of the model, it is important to consider the results from the survey and understand the distribution of SDO in the data set.The density plot below shows the distribution of <code>SDO</code> within the data set. The blue line represents the mean and the median in red. We see that both of these lines are very close together, the median is slightly smaller than the mean. Therefore, the average SDO value on a 5 point scale is ~2. However, there appears to be a large spike right at 1 and then a smaller one at 3. This shows that the most common SDO score was 1 and then 3, with an average around 2.</p>
<img src="http://example.org/post/2023-10-05-week-4-hierarchies/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" />
<h2 id="social-dominance-by-party">Social Dominance By Party</h2>
<p>Next, the density plots below break down SDO scores by party.</p>
<p>First, looking at the Democrat plot, we see that the most common score rating was dominantly 1. 2 and 3 were next, and there were no 4 or 5s. This indicates a possible connection between lower SDO scores for Democrats.</p>
<p>Looking at the Independent chart, there is a similar trend to the Democrat Chart, but with a lower magnitude. 1,2,3, all have similar densities, 4 has a very small number of people, and 5 has no people.</p>
<p>Finally, looking at the Republican graph, there is a parabolic nature to the density plot, with a maximum value at 3. The density for 3 on this graph is the highest among the three graphs. Similar to the other graphs, there are very few people at 4 and non at 5. The difference between this graph and the other two is that scores 1 and 2 do not have the highest density on the graph.</p>
<p>These three graphs display a possible link between party affiliation and SDO score. As people get more conservative, their SDO score similarly increases.</p>
<img src="http://example.org/post/2023-10-05-week-4-hierarchies/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" />
<h2 id="sdo-and-party-affiliation">SDO and Party Affiliation</h2>
<p>The chart below looks at the correlation between SDO score and political affiliation. To measure political affiliation, the variable <code>favor_trump</code> is used. This variable goes from 1-4 with 4 being associated with &ldquo;very favorable&rdquo;. In the chart below, each circle represents a different coordinate of SDO and Trump favorability. The size of the circle corresponds to the proportion of individuals with that score for Trump, among individuals with a certain SDO score. For example, at point (1,1) on the graph, the circle represents the proportion of individuals who no favorability for Trump (1) among those that also have a SDO score of 1.</p>
<p>From the chart, we can see that at scores 1 and 4 for Trump, there is a significant trend among the circles. At score 4, the circles get larger as SDO increases and at score 1, the circles get smaller as SDO increases. This follows the trend noticed in the earlier graphs. As SDO increases, people become more conservative.</p>

<h2 id="sdo-and-gender">SDO and Gender</h2>
<p>Next, we can consider the distribution of SDO scores by gender. From these graphs we see that women have lower SDO scores than men. The spike at SDO of 1 is significiantly higher for females than males.</p>

<h2 id="fitting-a-model">Fitting a Model</h2>
<p>After evaluating the relationship between SDO and party affiliation, I created a model with republican votes in the 2016 presidential election the outcome variable. In order to make the model, I first had to add two variables, <code>white</code> and <code>rep_votes</code>. <code>white</code> considers race as binary variable, with &ldquo;white&rdquo; being 1 and all other cases as 0. <code>rep_votes</code> is also a binary variable, with Trump as 1 and any other candidate 0.</p>
<p>I fit three models and display the results in the table below:</p>

<h4 id="model-1-just-sdo">Model 1: Just SDO</h4>
<p>In the first model, I just look at the predictive power of SDO on republican votes. Importantly, we see that the coefficient for SDO is significant at the 95% confidence interval. This means there is a .304 increase in Trump vote for additional unit increase in SDO. The adjusted R^2 value is 0.320.</p>
<h4 id="model-2-sdo-and-demographics-model">Model 2: SDO and Demographics model</h4>
<p>The second model considers SDO along with gender, race, education, and age. In this model, all variables are significant at the 95% confidence level except for race. The adjusted R^2 value is 0.361. This is slightly higher than model 1.</p>
<h4 id="model-3-sdo-demographics-and-ideology-model">Model 3: SDO, Demographics, and Ideology Model</h4>
<p>The third model considers all the variables (adding party and ideology). Like model 2, gender is the only variable that is not significantly significant. The adjusted R^2 for this model is much higher than the other 2 models, 0.680.</p>
<h4 id="model-4-sdo-demographics-no-gender-and-ideology-model">Model 4: SDO, Demographics (No Gender), and Ideology, Model</h4>
<p>The fourth, and final model, removes gender from the previous model. Now, all predictors are statistically significant and the adjusted R^2 value is 0.680.</p>
<h4 id="comparison-of-models">Comparison of Models</h4>
<p>Between the four models, the fourth most accurately fits the data because it has the highest adjusted R^2 value and all variables are statistically significant. Interestingly, Party ID and personal idealogy have the largest coefficients. These means, that when holding all the other variables constant, these variables will have the biggest sway in the outcome variable of republican votes. Intuitively, these results make sense because of the role party affiliation and political ideology plays in our polarized political scene. It is interesting to see education with such a low coefficient in magnitude. SDO is also a significant predictor, which makes sense given the correlation between party and SDO score shown earlier.</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>These results have larger implications in the political sphere when considering the role group affiliation has in society. The density graphs and the models demonstrate that SDO is a strong predictor of party affiliation. For Democrats, lower SDO scores tend to dominate, whereas Republicans see higher SDO scores. This means Democrats are less concerned about group identity and more accepting toward those considered in lower or under-represented groups. In fact, this idea was explored in Kteily, Rocklage, McClanahan, and Ho&rsquo;s paper &ldquo;Political ideology shapes the amplification of the accomplishments of disadvantaged vs. advantaged group members.&rdquo; During the 2016 Olympics, they compared retweeting stats between Democrats and Republicans for gold medalists. They found that liberals were more likely to tweet about Black and female athletes than conservatives (pgs. 1560-1561).</p>
<p>These findings connect to the trends with SDO as gender and race are common group identities. Non-white and females are under recognized and lower class groups in the today&rsquo;s society. Therefore, the tweeting patterns demonstrate conservatives are less inclined to promote these group and remove group biases than liberals. Although this study has limitations, primarily with external validity and extrapolating tweeting patterns to real life, I think the study is fairly legit. With the prominence of social media in everyday life, patterns with tweeting and followers appears to just be an extension a person&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Outside of party affiliation, the gender differences in SDO scores discusses in this blog is also corroborated in Each and Crabtree&rsquo;s paper &ldquo;Gender differences in the prosecution of police assault: Evidence from a natural experiment in Sweden.&rdquo; This natural experiment utilized the random appointment of prosecutors in Sweden to evaluate the probability that a police assault claim will be investigated. They find that &ldquo;women special prosecutors are around 16 percentage points more likely to investigate police assault in Sweden than their male counterparts&rdquo; (Eck, Crabtree, pg. 16). Although this study does not identify a mechanism for these results, the study demonstrates that women are more likely to question police violence, which relates to lower SDO scores, as police hold can hold a higher status in society given their power over individuals.</p>
<p>With regard to current events, we can see SDO scores at play as one of the factors for the removal of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. One of the major reasons McCarthy was removed from office was for his attempts at reaching across the aisle and passing a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/10/04/1203462629/kevin-mccarthy-speaker-matt-gaetz-congress-vote#:~:text=Kevin%20McCarthy%20became%20the%20first%20speaker%20removed%20by%20a%20U.S.%20House%20vote.,-Mandel%20Ngan%2FAFP&amp;text=via%20Getty%20Images-,Kevin%20McCarthy's%20run%20as%20speaker%20was%20relatively%20short%20and%20anything,vote%20to%20vacate%20the%20seat.">spending-bill with Democratic support</a>. Although lack of bipartisanship is strong for both parties, this example demonstrates how McCarthy&rsquo;s decision to concede with the minority and out-group, the Democrats, made him unappealing for Republicans. This low-score SDO act went against the high-score SDO values conservatives typically hold.</p>
